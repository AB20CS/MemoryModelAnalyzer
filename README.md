# SimpleMemModAnalyzer

## Approach
#### Overview
The output is generated by reading off the entries in a series of structs that are filled up as the program reads through the source code. Below is a summary of the structs and their fields:
| struct | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `Stats` | name, number of lines and number of functions in the source code being read |
| `FunctionNode` | name of the function, number of lines and variables in the function |
| `MemNode` | name, scope, type and size of the variable |

In the program, there is one `Stats` struct, one linked list of `FunctionNode` nodes and four linked list of `MemNode` nodes (one linked list for each of the segments of memory - i.e., read-only data, static data, heap and stack).

#### Parsing Details
_**Deciding if a function is being read:**_
- There is a boolean flag that holds whether a function is currently being read. If the boolean flag is true, there cannot be a function header that is read.
- The boolean flag is set to true when a function header is read.
- In order to decide if a function header was read, the following criteria were checked:
  - the line does not contain `;`
  - the line must contain `(`
  - the first word in the line must be an accepted variable type
- The end of the function is realized when a line whose only non-whitespace character is `}` is read.

_**Deciding where in memory a variable is stored:**_
- All parameters passed into functions were read by tokenizing the function headers using commas as the delimiter. All of these variables are stored in the stack.
- To determine if the a variable is declared in a non-function-header line, the program checks if the line begins with an accepted variable type and ends with a semi-colon.
  - If the line begins with `const` or `static`, the word after these indentifiers is used as the "first word".
- If the `static` identifier is used or if the variable is read while a function is not being read, the variable is stored in the static data segment.
- If `malloc` is a substring of the line, the pointer variable declared is stored on the stack and the space allocated is stored on the heap.
- If `="` or '= "` is a substring of the line, a string literal is initialized. The pointer is stored on the stack and string is stored in the read-only (RO) data segment.
- If there are square brackets in the line, an array is declared (will be stored on the stack). The size reserved by the array is decided in one of two ways:
  - If there is a numerical value between the square brackets, the numerical value indicates the number of elements. The size reserved is the number of elements multiplied by the size of a single element (determined by the array type).
  - If there is a curly bracket in the line, the array elements are initialized in the form `type arr[] = {_, _, ... , _};`. In this case, the number of elements is one more than the number of commas within the curly brackets.

_**Miscellaneous:**_
- Any text after `//` in any line is ignored by only taking the text before it using `strtok`.
- Any whitespace characters (i.e., tabs, spaces) in the beginning of each line are ignored for the purposes of parsing through the source code.

## Function Overview
#### Primary Functions
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bool isFunctionHeader(char *line, char **types, int num_types)` | Returns true if and only if `line` is a function header, where `types` is an array of all valid types and `num_types` is the size of the array `types` |
| `FunctionNode *initFunction(char *header, FunctionNode *func_head, MemNode *stack_head)` | Initializes a FunctionLL node for the current function whose header is `header` and inserts the new node in the linked list whose head is `head` |
| `bool isVar(char *line, char **types, int num_types, FunctionNode *curr_func, MemNode *ro_head, MemNode *static_head, MemNode *heap_head, MemNode *stack_head)` | Returns true if anf only if `line` contains a variable declaration and inserts the variable into the appropriate linked list if a variable is contained, where `types` is an array of all valid types and `num_types` is the size of the array `types`|
| `int readFile(Stats *stats, int argc, char **argv, FunctionNode *func_head, MemNode *ro_head, MemNode *static_head, MemNode *heap_head, MemNode *stack_head)` | Iterates and reads through lines of source file. Returns 0 if and only if there is a valid file indicated by user |
| `void printOutput(Stats *stats, FunctionNode *func_head, MemNode *ro_head, MemNode *static_head, MemNode *heap_head, MemNode *stack_head)` | Prints the output given information read from source file |

#### Helper Functions
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `int getSize(char *type, int num_elements)` | Returns the size of memory occupied by `num_elements` elements of type `type` |
| `void insertFuncNode(FunctionNode *func_head, FunctionNode *node)` | Inserts FunctionNode `node` into linked list whose head is `head` |
| `void insertMemNode(MemNode *func_head, MemNode *node)` | Inserts MemNode `node` into linked list whose head is `head` |
| `void deleteFunctionList(FunctionNode *head)` | Deletes a FunctionNode linked list whose head is `head` |
| `void deleteMemList(MemNode *head)` | Deletes a MemNode linked list whose head is `head` |
| `bool isWhitespace(char *str)` | Returns true iff `str` is whitespace |

## Running the Program
  1. Navigate to the directory (i.e., `cd`) in which `SimpleMemModAnalyzer.c` is saved on your machine.
  2. In the terminal, enter `gcc SimpleMemModAnalyzer.c -o SimpleMemModAnalyzer` to compile the program.
  3. To execute the program, enter `./SimpleMemModAnalyzer file.c` into the terminal, where `file` is the name of the file with the C source code.

## Test Cases
#### Test Case #1
- Contains global variables (part of static data) 
- All variables in functions should go to the stack
- Empty heap and RO data
- Comments are present (should be ignored by program)

**Source Code:**
```
// evil global variables
int evil_glob_var_1;
float evil_glob_var_2;

void fun1(int x)
{
  int y;
  int z;
  printf("%d \n", x+y+z); 
}

int fun2(float z)
{
   float x;
   return (int)(z+x);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  int w;

  fun1(w);
  fun2();

  return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
